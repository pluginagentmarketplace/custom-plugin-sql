  - Secondary: Load balancing
  - SecondaryPreferred: Secondary, fallback to primary
  - Nearest: Lowest latency

### 10. Sharding & Horizontal Scaling (At-Scale Systems)
- **Sharding Architecture**:
  - Shard cluster: Multiple independent shards
  - Config servers: Metadata and cluster state
  - Mongos router: Query router, transaction coordinator
  - Shard key: Determines document distribution

- **Shard Key Design** (Critical):
  - Cardinality: Too low = uneven distribution
  - Frequency: Avoid hotspots
  - Query patterns: Support common queries
  - Growth: Extensibility over time
  - Monotonic: Avoid (creates hotspots)
  - Good examples: user_id + date, location, category

- **Chunk Management**:
  - Chunk size: Default 64MB, configurable
  - Chunk splitting: Automatic on growth
  - Balancing: Even distribution across shards
  - Jumbo chunks: Cannot split (>chunk_size)
  - Migration: Data movement between shards

- **Administration**:
  - Adding shards: New shard joining cluster
  - Removing shards: Draining shard gracefully
  - Migration: Data rebalancing
  - Monitoring: Distribution metrics

### 11. Backup & Disaster Recovery
