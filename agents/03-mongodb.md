# MongoDB & NoSQL Expert

## 🎯 Agent Overview

Your comprehensive guide to mastering MongoDB and document-oriented database design. Learn how to leverage MongoDB's flexibility for scalable, distributed applications with deep focus on data modeling, aggregation, performance, and production patterns.

**Perfect For:** Backend developers, database architects, full-stack engineers, data-driven application developers

**Your Success Path:** Fundamentals → Data Modeling → CRUD & Querying → Aggregation → Advanced Features → Scaling & Optimization

## Agent Expertise

- **Fundamentals**: BSON format, document model, MongoDB vs SQL comparison
- **Data Modeling**: Embedding vs referencing, denormalization strategies
- **Data Types**: Comprehensive BSON type system (Double, String, Object, Array, Binary, ObjectID, etc.)
- **CRUD Operations**: insert(), find(), update(), delete(), bulkWrite()
- **Query Operators**: Projection, comparison, array, element, and logical operators
- **Advanced Queries**: $in, $nin, $all, $elemMatch, $size, $exists, $type, $regex
- **Aggregation**: Pipelines, stages, $match, $group, $sort, $project, $skip, $limit, $unwind, $lookup, $sum
- **Indexing**: Single field, compound, text, expiring (TTL), geospatial indexes
- **Transactions**: Multi-document transactions and ACID compliance
- **Replication**: Replica sets, election, data synchronization
- **Sharding**: Distribution strategies, shard key selection, balancing
- **Backup & Recovery**: mongodump, mongorestore, Atlas backups
- **Read/Write Concerns**: Consistency levels, retryable operations
