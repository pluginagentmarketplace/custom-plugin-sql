- **Data Formats**: Structured (CSV, databases), semi-structured (JSON, XML), unstructured (text, images, logs)
- **Data Collection**: Extraction methods, sampling strategies, batch vs real-time, API rate limiting
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Completeness, accuracy, consistency, timeliness evaluation

### 2. SQL for Analytics (Complete)
- **SELECT Queries**: Basic to advanced, projection, column aliases, expressions, CASE statements
- **Filtering**: WHERE clauses, complex conditions, NULL handling, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE patterns
- **Data Types in Analytics**: Type casting, format conversion, implicit vs explicit casting
- **String Functions**: CONCAT, SUBSTRING, UPPER, LOWER, LENGTH, TRIM, REPLACE, SPLIT, POSITION
- **Math Functions**: ROUND, CEIL, FLOOR, ABS, POWER, SQRT, MOD operations
- **Aggregation Functions**: COUNT (with DISTINCT), SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP_CONCAT
- **Window Functions**: ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, LEAD, FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Deep-Dive)
- **Data Profiling**: Row counts, column statistics, data type verification, null analysis
- **Distribution Analysis**: Frequency distributions, skewness, kurtosis, outlier identification
- **Central Tendency**: Mean, median, mode, geometric mean, weighted averages
- **Dispersion Measures**: Range, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, IQR
- **Correlation & Covariance**: Relationship analysis, correlation matrices, dependency detection
- **Pattern Recognition**: Trends, seasonality, cyclicity, anomalies, breakpoints

### 4. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- **Handling Missing Data**:
  - Detection (NULL, empty strings, special values)
  - Strategies (deletion, imputation, forward/backward fill)
  - Context-aware approaches for different column types
- **Duplicate Detection & Removal**:
  - Exact duplicates, near-duplicates, fuzzy matching
  - Business rule duplicates vs technical duplicates
- **Outlier Handling**:
  - IQR method, z-score, isolation forests
  - Domain-based outlier detection
  - Keep, cap, or remove decision frameworks
- **Data Type Standardization**: Consistent formats, encoding, normalization
- **Regex-based Cleaning**: Pattern matching, text extraction, validation

### 5. Statistical Analysis & Advanced Metrics
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summary tables, frequency analysis, cumulative distributions
- **Comparative Analysis**: T-tests, ANOVA, chi-square, effect size calculation
- **Cohort Analysis**: Defining cohorts, tracking cohort progression, retention curves
- **Segment Analysis**: Customer segments, behavioral segments, RFM analysis
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson, Spearman, Kendall correlations
- **Time-based Metrics**: Running totals, moving averages, year-over-year growth, decay functions

### 6. Advanced Query Patterns
- **Multi-level Aggregation**: Nested aggregations, subqueries in GROUP BY
- **Complex JOINs**: Self-joins, outer joins for asymmetric analysis, anti-joins
- **Recursive Queries**: Hierarchical data analysis, path traversal
- **Set Operations**: UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT for comparative analysis
- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions)**: Temporary result sets, recursive CTEs, readability
