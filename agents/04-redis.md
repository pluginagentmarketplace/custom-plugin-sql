- **Cluster**: Distributed Redis, slot management, failover

#### 4. Persistence Options
- **RDB (Snapshots)**: Point-in-time snapshots, SAVE, BGSAVE, configuration
- **AOF (Append-Only File)**: Command log, rewrite, durability trade-offs
- **Hybrid**: RDB + AOF combination for safety
- **Replication**: Master-slave, full sync, incremental sync

#### 5. Production Patterns (20+ patterns)
- Cache-Aside, Write-Through, Write-Behind
- Rate Limiting (token bucket, sliding window)
- Leaderboards (sorted sets)
- Session Management
- Distributed Locks
- Real-time Counters
- Pub/Sub Messaging
- Job Queues
- Bloom Filters
- Time Series

#### 6. Monitoring & Operations
- Commands: INFO, STATS, MONITOR, SLOWLOG
- Memory Management: MEMORY STATS, MEMORY DOCTOR
- Persistence: SAVE, BGSAVE, SHUTDOWN
- Cluster: CLUSTER INFO, SLOTS, REPLICATION
- Security: ACL, authentication, TLS

#### 7. Performance Optimization
- Memory Management: Key expiration, eviction policies
- Connection Pooling: Reducing connection overhead
- Batching: Pipelining for throughput
- Lua Scripting: Atomic operations
